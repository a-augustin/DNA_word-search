DNA Word Search

A program to determine whether or not each word (i.e., string) in a given list of
words (strings) is found in a given 2D array of characters. This array will be rectangular, with each element
of the array taking values in the set {A, C, G, T} (representing the four DNA nucleobases adenine (A),
cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T)). The list of words will consist of strings formed from these
alphabets. A string is contained in the array if it is a substring of some row, column, diagonal, or
antidiagonal, either in the forward or reversed direction.
